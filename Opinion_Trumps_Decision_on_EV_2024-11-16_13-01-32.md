President-elect Donald Trump's reported plan to eliminate the EV tax credit has sparked debate among analysts, with some suggesting that the move could have a significant impact on the electric vehicle (EV) industry. While the decision would hurt Tesla, it could be catastrophic for Elon Musk's competition, according to experts.

## Impact on Tesla

Wedbush analysts believe that the elimination of the EV tax credit would have a limited impact on Tesla, as the company has a strong market presence and competitive advantage. While it may affect demand for Tesla vehicles in the US to some extent, the company's scale and scope set it apart from traditional car manufacturers.

On the earnings call earlier this year, Elon Musk acknowledged that losing the tax credit would have a slight impact on Tesla but emphasized that it would be devastating for competitors. Musk's close relationship with Trump could potentially influence the administration's EV policy, offering a silver lining for Tesla.

## Potential Consequences for Competitors

On the other hand, other EV manufacturers, including Ford, GM, and Rivian, could face significant challenges if the EV tax credit is eliminated. While GM and Rivian may not be as severely impacted as some predict, it would still be a setback for the industry as a whole.

Wedbush analysts warn that the removal of the tax credit could slow down Detroit's shift to EVs in the coming years. However, the growing trend towards electrification in the auto industry suggests that the move may not halt the progress entirely.

## Conclusion

While Trump's decision to eliminate the EV tax credit could have mixed consequences for the industry, it is clear that Tesla and its competitors will be affected differently. Tesla's strong position and Musk's influence may mitigate some of the negative impacts, but it remains to be seen how the broader EV market will adapt to the changes.

In the end, the fate of the EV industry will depend on a combination of government policies, market dynamics, and consumer preferences. Regardless of the outcome, the shift towards electrification seems inevitable, and companies will need to adapt to survive in this evolving landscape.
